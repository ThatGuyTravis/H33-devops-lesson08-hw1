            <p>Rocky Road is a chocolate-based ice cream flavor mixed with chopped almonds and marshmallow pieces. While most Americans are familiar with Rocky Road ice cream, many are unaware that it was originally inspired by a brownie-like dessert also called Rocky Road.

                The milk chocolate, cake-like treat can be traced back to Australia. Unsure of what to do with confectionary treats that had gone bad during shipment from Britain, savvy confectioners got creative. The soft candy confections were mixed with chocolate and locally grown nuts. The chocolate flavor covered up the spoiled flavor of the candy while nuts provided a wonderfully crunchy texture. The popular dessert spread back to Britain and eventually the United States. (From https://www.braums.com/blog/everything-you-want-to-know-about-rocky-road/)</p>
